# mito_tracker_morphology
.m files are matlab codes for mitochondria tracking by following steps:
first detect mitochondria using peak signals after filtering (with parameters sigma and diameter), object is detected if peak signal is over certain threshold;
detected mitochondria is then tracked;
tracks can be made manually with eye proof by spliting and merging tracks;
finally save the tracks in .mat file. 


.ijm are ImagJ macro files for mitochondria morphology analysis
